Component can be function or class which returns html element.
Components are independent of each other.
in case of class based component it should extend React.COmponent class.


state and props ----

props --> means properties
passes data from parent to child
props is immutable


state is applicable for class
before react 16.8 version class component is used for maintaining state
before react 16.8 version there was no concept to maintain the state in functional component.
before 16.8 functional company duty was only to display data
but after 16.8 state is used inside functional component as well through react hooks useState()


state is a variable that will contain our component data.

We can modify the state data but cannot modify the props data.
props is used to pass data from parent to child and state is for its local data.
state is a local data for component.

Component create as a function or create as a class maintain state and return html element.
